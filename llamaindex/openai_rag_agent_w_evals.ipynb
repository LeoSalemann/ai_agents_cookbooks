      "\u001b[1;3;38;5;200mThought: I have information about the four pillars of Project 2025. However, none of these pillars seem to directly relate to the Hyde Amendment or the presidential action to enforce it. The Hyde Amendment is about preventing federal funds from being used for elective abortions, while Project 2025 is about governance, personnel databases, education, and transition plans. Therefore, it doesn't seem like any sections of Project 2025 are supported by the presidential action to enforce the Hyde Amendment.\n",
      "Answer: None of the sections of Project 2025 appear to be directly supported by the presidential action to enforce the Hyde Amendment. The Hyde Amendment and its enforcement through presidential action primarily concern the use of federal funds for elective abortions. On the other hand, Project 2025 focuses on federal agency governance, personnel databases, education, and transition plans. These topics do not seem to intersect with the Hyde Amendment or its enforcement.\n",
